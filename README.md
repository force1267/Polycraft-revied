# Revived
this is a fork of https://github.com/burnedpopcorn/PolyCRACK

- fixed game errors when loading with `./nwjs .`
- added offline support
- added shell script to release with nwjs

```bash
./build.sh --release
```

edit the `build.sh` to change the nwjs path

thanks to cursor editor, it did all the job


I hope this brings the game back to life. The game was originally crated using turbulenz and was hosted at https://ga.me/games/polycraft but was shutdown.
